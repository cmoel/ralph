# Specs

Single source of truth for specification status.

## Status Key

- **Ready** — Shaped and ready for implementation
- **In Progress** — An agent is actively working on this
- **Done** — All slices complete
- **Blocked** — Cannot proceed (see spec for details)

## Specs

| Spec | Status | Summary | Depends On |
|------|--------|---------|------------|
| — | — | No specs yet | — |

## Notes

When picking work:
- Choose specs marked **Ready**
- Respect dependencies (don't start a spec until its dependencies are Done)
- If multiple specs are Ready with no dependencies, pick what interests you
